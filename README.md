<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


FitBook is a fitness application designed to be used with various devices. We were tasked with taking large data files and connecting them via javaScript in order to create relatable, presentable information. 
The repository demonstrates:
  * expanded implementation of ES6 (syntax and prototype methods)
  * SRP and DRY code
  * accounting for multiple device sizes by utilizing responsive layout/design
  * adherance to Test Driven Development
  * considerations for accesibility
  * usage of third party libraries (Chart.js) to display data


### Languages Used
